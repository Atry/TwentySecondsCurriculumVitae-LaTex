%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{
I operate as half researcher, half engineer. The researcher in me creates and maintains open-source projects (3000+ stars) and publications in deep learning and functional programming. The engineer in me architects production systems from scratch for ambiguous domains, building the best practices for serverless LLM platforms and multi-agent systems where none existed before.

This duality defines my technical expertise: I am half systems programmer, half AI architect. I leverage a deep foundation in programming frameworks and performance engineering to build and operationalize the next frontier of AI.
