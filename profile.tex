%	 ABOUT ME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\aboutme{
	I am a Machine Learning Engineer focused on architecting and operationalizing reliable, high‑leverage ML and language model platforms end‑to‑end.

	I blend deep systems engineering (performance, reliability, observability) with functional programming to create concise, extensible, and correct abstractions for data, model, and multi‑agent workflows.

	A long‑time open‑source maintainer (3000+ GitHub stars across frameworks for neural networks, reactive UI, micro‑services, and DSLs), I emphasize automation, clarity of design, and sustainable velocity over ad‑hoc complexity.

	I bring a product mindset, rigorous engineering standards, and a bias toward serverless scalability, safety, and measurability in every ML system I help shape.
